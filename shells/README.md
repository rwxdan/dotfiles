# List of dependencies
Doesn't matter whether you go with fish or zsh, if you're going to use some of these configs you need some tools first to avoid complains.
- [Starship](https://starship.rs)
- [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)
- [Exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa)
- [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
**Note**: for fish you'll also need (oh-my-fish)[https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish] to be installed before running the fish shell for the first time. Also, please run `fisher update` once you're done, that'll update any plugins out-of-date.
